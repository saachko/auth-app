## Usage

At first you can create an account and sign in. Authenticated users have access to the user management table: id, name, e-mail, last login time, registration time, status (active/blocked). The left column of the table contains checkboxes without labels for multiple selection and there is a toolbar over the table with the flooring actions: Block, Unblock, Delete. Non-authenticated users don't have access to the user management.

## Stack:

- react
